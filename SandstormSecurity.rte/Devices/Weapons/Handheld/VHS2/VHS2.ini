	Description = This is a "multifunctional Croatian machine gun", a 5.56x45mm bullpup rifle. It looks like a less French and more Croatian FAMAS when stock, but this particular version is kitted out to hell with a 50-round drum magazine, a foregrip, a red dot sight, and a MASSIVE muzzle brake. It won't help, but boy does it look cool.
